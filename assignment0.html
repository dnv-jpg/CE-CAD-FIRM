      <h2>Video 1: Bentley Quality Design</h2>
      <p>Video 1 talks about the design and engineering ideas in the Bentley Continental GT in an interview with John Crawford, the public relations director for Bentley Motors North America. The main engineering issue talked about in the video was how Bentley kept producing luxury cars and mastered the design and performance side. Crawford talked about how the high demand for Continental GT, and how it was the best in the market. It had an MSRP of $238,000 and still had a long waiting list. Crawford explained that Bentley focuses on combining performance, luxury, and exclusivity while still keeping the brand's identity strong. Bentley is defined by its design, performance and the prestige that comes with owning one. Crawford also talked about how the quality and craftsmanship is important in Bentley.</p>

      <h2>Video 2: Chemical Engineering Process (Siemens)</h2>
      <p>Video 2 talks about the importance of automation and monitoring technology in chemical engineering. It interviews Vincent Turmel, PHD Systems Specialist at RPocess Automation Systems, Siemens Energy and Automation, Inc. The main engineering issues talked about in the video is how chemical plants monitor machines and its safely so it runs efficiently. Turmel explained that the automation systems help engineers see the real time data like pressure, flow and temperature through a control interface. The control interface helps detect problems, avoid shutdowns and safety risks. The system uses a controller that makes communication faster and more reliable compared to traditional systems.</p>

      <h2>Video 3: Cognex Vision Inspection</h2>
      <p> Video 3 talks about a manufacturing engineering project that uses machine vision inspection systems to improve quality control. The goal is to automatically check products on the production line by detecting issues, verifying features and reading codes before deciding if a part is good or not. The engineering issue in the video is how to maintain high inspection accuracy while keeping production fast and efficient.

      <h2>Video 4: FANUC Fixtureless Robotic Assembly</h2>
      <p>Video 4 talks about an advanced robotics project focused on fixtureless assembly using FANUC robotic systems. It is an industrial engineering project and the main goal is to eliminate traditional mechanical fixtures and rely on robotic intelligence instead of using traditional fixtures to hold parts in place. The robots would use sensors, programming and precise motion control to position and put together the components correctly. The main engineering issue talked about in the video was being able to get high precision without the rigid rapport structures that are normally used.

      <h2>Video 5: FLOW Waterjet Cutting</h2>
      <p> Video 5 talks about the FLOW waterject cutting technology and how it's used in advanced manufacturing to improve precision cutting. The main engineering goal talked about in this video was to cut different materials without causing heat damage that happens with other cutting methods. Waterjet systems use high pressure water mixed with abrasive particles to cut materials while keeping their structure the same. This method helped reduce errors and material waste. Engineers must carefully control the pressure, nozzle design and speed to have the best results. </p>

      <h2>Video 6: Ford Rouge Body</h2>
      <p> Video 6 talks about automated vehicle body production at the Ford Rouge manufacturing facility. The main engineering issue talked about in the video was how robotics, welding systems and material handling processes work together to produce vehicle parts efficiently while being able to meet the safety and quality standards. Engineers have to analyze production flow, cycle time, and equipment performance so that it runs smoothly and avoids delays. Sensors and real time data monitoring help detect problems early which improves reliability and efficiency. This video showed how engineering management, automation and process optimization work together to increase productivity.
